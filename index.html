<p>This is my JSC370 Final Project website.</p>
<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Social stability and security can have a significant impact on our
daily living conditions and quality. Living in a stable and secure
social environment can positively affect people’s health and well-being
both physically and mentally, it can contribute to a stable economic
environment and also provide people a sense of connection and belonging
to the society.</p>
<p>The number of homicides is a key indicator of social stability and
security, and can also provide insights for social cohesion, governance
and strength of law enforcement. Understanding the number of homicides
can help to identify trends and patterns, as well as the factors
correlated with the number of homicides can inform individual decisions,
research and various political decisions related to law enforcement,
public health, and social services.</p>
<p>The number of homicides is also a key indicator of violence present
in a certain area. Reducing the number of homicides will reduce
violence, and it is a key objective of the United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 16: Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions. In
order to achieve this goal, understanding the root causes of violence
actions such as healthcare resources, social inequalities and designing
specific strategies to eliminate them is very important. Understanding
the root causes behind the number of homicides makes a big step towards
achieving SDG 16.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) is an international public health
agency of the United Nations, whose main objective is to promote health
and well-being for all countries around the world. The WHO focuses on
various health issues and factors that affect individual’s well-being
around the world. The number of homicides is an important indicator
considered by the WHO in its Global Health Observatory. In this project,
we will use the estimates of rates of homicides per 100,000 population
dataset provided by the WHO. WHO defines homicide to be the killing of a
person by another person with the intention of causing death or serious
injuries, and reckless or negligent cases are excluded in the dataset.
The dataset is an estimate of the number of homicides per 100,000
population for different countries around the globe drawn from data
provided from police of different countries, as well as data from the
United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and WHO’s mortality
database. It also provides estimates of the number of homicides for male
and female and contains information from 2000 to 2019.</p>
<p>In the report, we aim to answer the following two questions: “Is
there a correlation between the number of homicide cases and the number
of medical doctors in each country, and is there a correlation between
the number of homicide cases and the number of medical doctors together
with alcohol consumption level in each country?”</p>
<p>To do this, we will collect the number of medical doctors in each
country through WHO’s Global Health Workforce statistics database which
extracts the national reporting in the National Health Workforce
Accounts (NHWA) data platform, combining with various other sources such
as National Census and Labour Force Surveys. This dataset contains
information up to the year of 2000, and we will compare this information
together with WHO’s alcohol consumption situation for each country and
region dataset (provided for HW2) to the rate of homicide per 100,000
population provided by the WHO, to determine if there is a statistically
significant relationship.</p>
