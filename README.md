# The Reason Behind Homicide

## About this Project
Social security and stability are key to people’s well-being. This project aims to answer the following two questions: “Is there a correlation between the number of homicide cases and the number of medical doctors in each country, and is there a correlation between the number of homicide cases and the number of medical doctors together with alcohol consumption level in each country?” 

The data used in this project was collected and downloaded from WHO’s website and then loaded into R for analysis. After data cleaning and merging steps, we first performed data exploration on the datasets, and understood that as the rates of homicides (per 100,000 population) increase, the number of female homicide cases decreased and the estimate of alcohol consumption of females is more concentrated, and the estimate of alcohol consumption of males is more spread out. Also, majority of the country has less than 30 medical doctors per 10000 population, and many countries have very few (0-5) doctors per 10000 population. 

Then, we performed in-depth data analysis for our research questions, and we observed that the trend between homicide cases and alcohol consumption is against intuition, which suggests that using mean values of these variables of interest to analyze may not be a good idea. Hence, we focused on specific years and analyze if there is a trend between the number of homicide cases estimated and the number of medical doctors or alcohol consumption levels in different countries. We concluded that the number of homicide cases estimates per 100,000 population in that country and in that year of the given sex is correlated with the number of medical doctors per 10,000 population in the country together with the amount of alcohol consumption per capita of a certain sex in the country and year.
